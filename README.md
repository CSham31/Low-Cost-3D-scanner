# Low-Cost-3D-scanner
3d scanner is a very expensive device which is not affordable.Basically, the system points a laser at an object and calculates the exact distance, recording all the necessary contours and recesses, and feeds this information back to the computer. Once the model is scanned we can use it to 3d print or generate STL files to continue on design
